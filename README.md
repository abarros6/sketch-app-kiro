# Sketch Drawing App

A feature-rich 2D sketch drawing application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project demonstrates the power of spec-driven development using Kiro's AI-assisted workflow.

## Features

- **Multiple Drawing Modes**: Freehand, Line, Rectangle, Square, Ellipse, Circle
- **Object Selection**: Select and manipulate drawn objects
- **Color Picker**: Choose any color for your drawings
- **Undo/Redo**: Full command history with keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y)
- **Object Deletion**: Delete selected objects with the Delete key
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Docker Support**: Easy deployment with containerization

## How It Was Built

This project was developed using **Kiro's spec-driven development process**:

### 1. Requirements Gathering
- Started with a rough idea: "Create a sketch drawing program with basic shapes and selection"
- Kiro helped transform this into detailed requirements with user stories and acceptance criteria
- Added grouping and save/load functionality based on user feedback

### 2. Design Phase
- Created comprehensive technical design with architecture diagrams
- Defined data models, component interfaces, and error handling strategies
- Planned Docker containerization approach

### 3. Implementation Planning
- Generated 22 detailed implementation tasks
- Each task included specific coding objectives and requirement references
- Tasks were designed to build incrementally with proper testing

### 4. Iterative Development
- Initially started with React + TypeScript but encountered compatibility issues
- Pivoted to vanilla JavaScript for simplicity and reliability
- Kiro adapted the implementation to maintain all planned features

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Styling**: Pure CSS with responsive design
- **Containerization**: Docker with Nginx
- **Architecture**: Object-oriented design with command pattern for undo/redo

## Quick Start

### Using Docker (Recommended)
```bash
# Build the container
docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t sketch-app-dev .

# Run the application
docker run -p 3002:80 sketch-app-dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3002 in your browser.

### Local Development
Simply open `index.html` in your web browser - no build process required!

## Usage

1. **Select Drawing Mode**: Choose from freehand, geometric shapes, or selection mode
2. **Pick a Color**: Use the color picker to set your drawing color
3. **Draw**: Click and drag on the canvas to create shapes
4. **Select Objects**: Switch to select mode to choose and manipulate existing drawings
5. **Undo/Redo**: Use Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Y or the toolbar buttons
6. **Delete**: Select an object and press Delete key

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Ctrl + Z`: Undo
- `Ctrl + Y`: Redo  
- `Delete`: Remove selected object

## The Kiro Advantage

This project showcases how Kiro's AI-assisted development process enables:

- **Rapid Prototyping**: From idea to working application in hours
- **Comprehensive Planning**: Detailed specs prevent scope creep and missed requirements
- **Adaptive Development**: Ability to pivot technologies while maintaining feature completeness
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in error handling and user experience considerations
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated specs serve as living documentation

The entire development process was guided by AI, from requirements gathering through implementation, demonstrating the future of collaborative human-AI software development.
