# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a simple sketch drawing program implemented using vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, CSS, and Docker. Based on the original assignment specification, the application provides a 2D drawing space with multiple drawing modes, color selection, object manipulation capabilities, and advanced features like grouping, undo/redo, and save/load functionality. The program is designed to be platform-independent and runs in a web browser through a Docker container with nginx serving static files.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an artist, I want to draw freehand sketches on a 2D canvas, so that I can create organic and natural-looking drawings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects freehand drawing mode THEN the system SHALL allow continuous line drawing following mouse/touch movement
2. WHEN the user presses down and drags the mouse/finger THEN the system SHALL create a smooth continuous line path
3. WHEN the user releases the mouse/finger THEN the system SHALL complete the freehand stroke as a single object

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a designer, I want to draw precise geometric shapes (lines, rectangles, ellipses), so that I can create structured and accurate diagrams.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects straight line mode THEN the system SHALL allow drawing straight lines between two points
2. WHEN the user selects rectangle mode THEN the system SHALL allow drawing rectangles by defining opposite corners
3. WHEN the user selects ellipse mode THEN the system SHALL allow drawing ellipses by defining bounding rectangle
4. WHEN the user selects square mode THEN the system SHALL constrain rectangle drawing to equal width and height
5. WHEN the user selects circle mode THEN the system SHALL constrain ellipse drawing to equal width and height

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to draw polygons with multiple vertices, so that I can create complex multi-sided shapes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects open polygon mode THEN the system SHALL allow clicking multiple points to create connected line segments
2. WHEN the user selects closed polygon mode THEN the system SHALL automatically connect the last point to the first point
3. WHEN the user double-clicks or presses Enter THEN the system SHALL complete the polygon drawing
4. WHEN drawing a polygon THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback showing the current polygon state
5. WHEN the user clicks to add polygon points THEN the system SHALL show preview lines to the current mouse position

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a creative user, I want to select colors for my drawings, so that I can create visually appealing and organized artwork.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the color picker THEN the system SHALL display a color selection interface
2. WHEN the user selects a color THEN the system SHALL apply that color to subsequently drawn objects
3. WHEN the user draws any object THEN the system SHALL render it using the currently selected color
4. WHEN no color is selected THEN the system SHALL use a default color (black)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an editor, I want to select and manipulate existing objects, so that I can modify my drawings after creation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects selection mode THEN the system SHALL allow clicking on objects to select them
2. WHEN an object is selected THEN the system SHALL provide visual indication of selection (e.g., selection handles)
3. WHEN a selected object is dragged THEN the system SHALL move the object to the new position
4. WHEN the user presses delete key with an object selected THEN the system SHALL remove the object from the canvas
5. WHEN the user copies a selected object THEN the system SHALL create a duplicate at a slightly offset position

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user making mistakes, I want undo and redo functionality, so that I can easily correct errors and experiment with different approaches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user performs an action (draw, move, delete, etc.) THEN the system SHALL record the action in the undo history
2. WHEN the user triggers undo THEN the system SHALL reverse the last action and update the canvas
3. WHEN the user triggers redo THEN the system SHALL reapply the last undone action
4. WHEN there are no actions to undo THEN the system SHALL disable the undo function
5. WHEN there are no actions to redo THEN the system SHALL disable the redo function

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clean and intuitive interface, so that I can focus on creating without being distracted by complex controls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a drawing canvas and tool selection interface
2. WHEN the user switches between modes THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual indication of the active mode
3. WHEN the user hovers over tools THEN the system SHALL display helpful tooltips
4. WHEN the canvas is empty THEN the system SHALL provide visual cues about how to start drawing

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user organizing complex drawings, I want to group objects together, so that I can manipulate multiple related objects as a single unit.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects multiple objects THEN the system SHALL provide a group option
2. WHEN the user groups selected objects THEN the system SHALL create a group containing those objects
3. WHEN a grouped object is selected THEN the system SHALL select the entire group
4. WHEN a group is moved, deleted, or copied THEN the system SHALL apply the operation to all objects in the group
5. WHEN the user chooses to ungroup THEN the system SHALL dissolve the group and make individual objects selectable again
6. WHEN a group is selected THEN the system SHALL provide visual indication that it's a group

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user working on projects over time, I want to save and load my sketches, so that I can preserve my work and continue editing later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user chooses to save THEN the system SHALL serialize the current drawing state to a file
2. WHEN the user provides a filename THEN the system SHALL save the sketch with that name
3. WHEN the user chooses to load THEN the system SHALL present available saved sketches
4. WHEN the user selects a saved sketch THEN the system SHALL restore the drawing state from the file
5. WHEN loading a sketch THEN the system SHALL preserve all object properties, colors, and groupings
6. WHEN saving or loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error messages

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer/user, I want the application to run in a Docker container, so that it can be easily deployed and run consistently across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built THEN the system SHALL create a Docker image containing all necessary dependencies
2. WHEN the Docker container is started THEN the system SHALL serve the application on a specified port
3. WHEN accessing the application through the container THEN the system SHALL provide full functionality
4. WHEN the container is stopped and restarted THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent behavior
